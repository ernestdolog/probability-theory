# Dispersion

At the **expected value** section we made a case study about an investment idea of putting 30 EUR on roulette. This investment has an $E(X)$ of $29,54 EUR$. We stated that this **excepted value** thingy is a value what possible outcomes will be situated around...

but with what dispersion?

Dispersion: $D(X)$

and:

$D(X) = \sqrt{E(X^2) - E^2(X)}$

Okay, so what does this mean?

Second momentum: $E(X^2)=\sum X_i^2 P(X_i)$

$E^2(X)$ means square of **expected value**

So:

$D(X) = \sqrt{E(X^2) - E^2(X)} = \sqrt{40^2 \times 0,487 + 30^2 \times 0,25 + 20^2 \times 0,128 + 0^2 \times 0,135 - 29,54^2} = 13,52$
