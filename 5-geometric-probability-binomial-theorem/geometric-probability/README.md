# Geometric Probability

$P = {\frac{T_{seeked}}{T_{all}}}$

Geometric possibility means that in 1->$\infty$ amount of dimensions we can set up **seeked** results by a function. It will answer the question, how much possibility it has, that our data is in some relation with out functions.

> Easiest to imagine it with real territories. We throw darts. What is the possibility that in a $r=60cm$ aim we throw into the most middle $R=10cm$ circle. So **seeked** results mean our points are in relation with $T=R^2\times 𝜋$ seeked function that they are inside it. And all possibilities are inside the $t=r^2\times 𝜋$ function.

Let's take now an other, simple 2 dimensions example. **The Phonejacker** orders very important stuff online. It is delivered by 2 companies. Both delivery arrives between 5 and 6 o'clock. One deliveryman takes exactly 10 minutes to deliver. What is the probability that the 2 delieverymen meet each other. So they don't have more than 10 minutes between each other.

Let's draw it:

so:

$P = {\frac{T_{seeked}}{T_{all}}}$

$T_{all} = 60^2 = 3600$

$T_{seeked} = 60^2 - 50^2 = 1100$

$P = {\frac{1100}{3600}}$

This simple it is! :)
