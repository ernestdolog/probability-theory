# Classical possibilities

We have an amount of events, what sort of events can happen with what possibilities?
> For example we throw a traditional dice, let's see what sort of events can happen (if the throw succeeds with a number):

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

These are elementary events.

Events what build up from more elementary events:

 - we throw an odd number
 - we throw an even number
 - we throw a number greater than 2

Events have possibilities, what we get:

$ P(A) = {count-how-many-times-an-event-happens  \over count-how-many-elementary-events-we-got} = {4 (greater-than-2)  \over 6 (elementary-events)}$

> P -> possibility, A -> name of event

We can combine events:

A event: greater than 2

B event: even number

Union of 2 events:
\$ P(A \cup B) = {4  \over 6}$
> {3, 4, 5, 6}

Segment of 2 events:
\$ P(A \cap B) = {2  \over 6}$
> {4, 6}
