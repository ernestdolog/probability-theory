# Classical possibilities

We have an amount of events, what sort of events can happen with what possibilities?
> For example we throw a traditional dice, let's see what sort of events can happen (if the throw succeeds with a number):

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

These are elementary events.

Events what build up from more elementary events:

 - we throw an odd number
 - we throw an even number
 - we throw a number greater than 2

Events have possibilities, what we get:

$$ P(A) = {count_how_many_times_an_event_happens  \over count_how_many_elementary_events_we_got} = {4 (greater_than_2)  \over 6 (elementary_events)}$$

> P -> possibility, A -> name of event

We can combine events:

A event: greater than 2

B event: even number

Union of 2 events
$$ P(A \cup B) = {4  \over 6}$$
> {3, 4, 5, 6}

Segment of 2 events:
$$ P(A \cap B) = {2  \over 6}$$
> {4, 6}
