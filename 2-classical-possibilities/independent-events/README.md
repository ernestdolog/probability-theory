# Independent events

All events we call independet where this applies: $ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) $


Let's take an example:

Throwing with a 6 sided dice...

A event: greater than 2

$ P(A) = {4 \over 6} $

> {3, 4, 5, 6}

B event: even number

$ P(B) = {3 \over 6 }$

> {2, 4, 6}

$\color{green}P(A \cap B) = {2\over 6} = {3\over 6} \times {4\over 6}$

> {4, 6}

> The above means: A and B are independent, if their common possibility is the only and only combined event when **A AND B happens** (AND: multiplication, remember! :) )

Now let's see smth else:

C even: we throw 3 or 5

Are B and C independent?

$ P(B \cap C) = P(B) \times P(C) $

$\color{red} {2\over 6} = {3\over 6} \times {2\over 6} $

So B and C events aren't indeendent events. :)
