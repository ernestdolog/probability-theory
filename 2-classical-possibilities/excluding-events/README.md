# Excluding events

All events we call excluding where this applies: $ P(A \cap B) = 0 $, so event can't happen.


Let's take an example:

Throwing with a 6 sided dice...

A event: greater than 2

$ P(A) = {4 \over 6} $

> {3, 4, 5, 6}

B event: odd number

$ P(B) = {3 \over 6 }$

> {1, 3, 5}

$\color{red}P(A \cap B) = {2\over 6}$

> {4, 6}

So these events are not excluding.

----------------------------------------

Now let's see smth else:

C even: we throw 4 or 6

Are B and C excluding?

$\color{green} P(B \cap C) = 0$

We can't throw odd and 4 or 6.
