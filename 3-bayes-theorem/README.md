# Bayes Theorem

If we know the conditional possibility of event A for a full event systems all events, the possibility of A is calculateable.

There are 3 boxes where we have silver and gold coins. All in all 25 silver and 25 gold, all together 50 coins. We mix them into the boxes in a given way shown in the diagram. A fellow is choosing from them. What is his possibility to choose gold?

> Remember, choose from box 1 **OR** from box 2, **OR** from box 3. **OR**: possibilities are added up. :)
