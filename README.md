# probability-theory

I am getting into AI. For this matter looking to refresh my knowledge about probability theory. I will revisit my old uni notes, and try to write things in code, using python language. Wish me good luck, that i will be able to share a well organized, understandable, helpful guide about basics in this fun and fluff topic.
