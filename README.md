# probability-theory

I am getting into AI. For this matter looking to refresh my knowledge about probability theory. I will revisit my old uni notes, and try to write things in code, using python language. Wish me good luck, that i will be able to share a well organized, understandable, helpful guide about basics in this fun and fluff topic.

Myself I studied this stuff in hungarian language, so are my notes. I will write here everything in english. Maybe I will mistranslate this and that, please correct me if i'm wrong somewhere. :))
