# probability-theory

I am getting into AI. For this matter looking to refresh my knowledge about the hardline basics of probability theory, statistics aand linear optimization. Whenever dealing with data, I like to approximately imagine what is happening to it under the hood in a maybe imported function. Probability theory basics give a common way for all of us, how can we imagine data, and gives us very very handy tools to measure data from several perspectives. Other good to know thing is statistics, which gives summaries about data by given perspectives. Linear optimization is something what gives predictions. This is where I would like to really get. If/as I find my notes, i will push more contents over the basics... than I will update this README also. :)

Myself I studied this stuff in hungarian language, so are my notes. I will write here everything in english. Maybe I will mistranslate this and that, please correct me if i'm wrong somewhere. :))
