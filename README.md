# probability-theory

I am getting into AI. For this matter looking to refresh my knowledge about the hardline basics of probability theory. Whenever dealing with data, I like to approximately imagine what is happening to it under the hood in a maybe imported function. Probability theory basics give an approximate overview about some common parts of it. Other good to know thing is statistics. In this note I will also include good to know hard-line basics of that topic. If/as I find my notes, i will push more contents over the basics... than I will update this README also. :)

Myself I studied this stuff in hungarian language, so are my notes. I will write here everything in english. Maybe I will mistranslate this and that, please correct me if i'm wrong somewhere. :))
