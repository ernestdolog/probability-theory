# Continous Probability Distributions

Distributions of continous probability variables. Generally they are for times, or continous quantities, like liters, kilogramms, smth. Stuff, where $P(X=a) = 0$, where we can only ask intervals, like $P(X < a)$, $P(X > a)$, $P(a < X < b)$

> $P(X=a) = 0$ means, that if we order a 0,5l beer, we will either get a little more, or a little less. Never exactly 0,5000000l

We have the following distributions, and their basic functions:

To get $P$-s, we can do the following:

### Uniform Distribution:

We are waiting a phone call. (yay! ðŸ˜±) Call will come between 2p.m. and 7p.m., all times with the same possibility. What is the possibility, that we will get it before 4p.m.?

> X = what is the time

$P(X < 4) = ?$

$$P(X < 4) = F(4) =
\begin{cases}
0,  & \text{x â‰¤ A} \\
{\frac{x-A}{B-A}}, & \text{A < x â‰¤ B} \\
1,  & \text{B < x} \\
\end{cases} = 
\begin{cases}
0,  & \text{x â‰¤ 2} \\
{\frac{x-2}{7-2}}, & \text{2 < x â‰¤ 7} \\
1,  & \text{7 < x} \\
\end{cases} = 
{\frac{4-2}{7-2}} =
{\frac{2}{5}} =
0,4
