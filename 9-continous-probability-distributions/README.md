# Continous Probability Distributions

Distributions of continous probability variables. Generally they are for times, or continous quantities, like liters, kilogramms, smth. Stuff, where $P(X=a) = 0$, where we can only ask intervals, like $P(X < a)$, $P(X > a)$, $P(a < X < b)$

> $P(X=a) = 0$ means, that if we order a 0,5l beer, we will either get a little more, or a little less. Never exactly 0,5000000l

We have the following distributions, and their basic functions:

To get $P$-s, we can do the following:
