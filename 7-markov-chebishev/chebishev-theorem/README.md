# Chebishev Theorem

It says that difference from $E(X)$ can't be too big.

$|X-E(X)|$ means difference from $E(X)$ (expected value). So it doesn't have a big possibility that this difference is too big.

Let's interpret it with a story:

We have our friend in sales departement, who sells products with $E(X)=64$ a day. According to our researches, his $D(X)=8$.
Let's judge with what possibility the amount of products sold by him that day is between 50 and 78.

We have 2 types of Chebishev equilibrium. One checking events over a stadium, one checking events inside a stadium. Now we will need the 2nd type:
